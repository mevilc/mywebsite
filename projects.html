    <h3>Perception/Logistic Regression</h3>
    Trained a supervised machine learning algorithm to binary classify feature data using a perceptron
    (with gradient descent) and logistic regression (sigmoid activation).

    <h3>Agent Reinforcement Learning</h3>
    <img src="img/HW3-1.png" alt="HW3" width="200" height="200">
    <br><br>Used a Q-learning algorithm to train an agent using rewards and punishments to traverse through a maze from 
    start to goal state. Agent randomly explores/exploits using an e - greedy method. Uses the Bellman Equation
    to update the Q-values for each action at all possible states.

    <h3>Adversarial Search - AI</h3>
    <img src="img/HW2.png" alt="HW2" width="500" height="250">
    <br><br>Implemented an alpha-beta pruning algorithm to traverse through a tree and choose states intelligently to relax.

    <h3>Pancake Flipping</h3>
    <img src="img/HW1.png" alt="HW1" width="400" height="100">
    <br><br>Built a robust Breadth-First and A* Search algorithm to solve the pancake flipping problem. Imple- mented a graph 
    in Python and used a heuristic function based on out-of-place pancakes.

    <h3>Hip Exoskeleton Suit</h3>
    Built a 3D CAD model and a MATLAB GUI program to interact with the CAD model. Fed GUI in- formation to SolidWorks 
    to resize suit proportionally to a person. Used Simulink to analyze model behaviour to different hip kinematics and 
    dynamics and make it fail-safe.
