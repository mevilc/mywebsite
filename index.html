    <!--About-->
    <p id="info">
        Welcome to my page! I am hosting this website on <i>Github Pages</i> while learning (and implementing) <i>HTML</i> and 
       <i>CSS</i> (crudely) to power it.

       <br><br> My name is Mevil Crasta and I grew up in India, moved to Canada in 2012, and then to the US in 2019.

       <br><br> I completed my bachelors in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Ottawa in 2021. I am currently doing my masters
       in Robotics at the University of Delaware.

       <br><br>My interests lie in robotics, programming, AI/ML, and autonomous systems.<br>
    </p>

    <!--Projects-->
    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p id="about">
        <h3>Perception/Logistic Regression</h3>
        Trained a supervised machine learning algorithm to binary classify feature data using a perceptron
        (with gradient descent) and logistic regression (sigmoid activation).

        <h3>Agent Reinforcement Learning</h3>
        <img src="img/HW3-1.png" alt="HW3" width="200" height="200">
        <br><br>Used a Q-learning algorithm to train an agent using rewards and punishments to traverse through a maze from 
        start to goal state. Agent randomly explores/exploits using an e - greedy method. Uses the Bellman Equation
        to update the Q-values for each action at all possible states.

        <h3>Adversarial Search - AI</h3>
        <img src="img/HW2.png" alt="HW2" width="500" height="250">
        <br><br>Implemented an alpha-beta pruning algorithm to traverse through a tree and choose states intelligently to relax.

        <h3>Pancake Flipping</h3>
        <img src="img/HW1.png" alt="HW1" width="400" height="100">
        <br><br>Built a robust Breadth-First and A* Search algorithm to solve the pancake flipping problem. Imple- mented a graph 
        in Python and used a heuristic function based on out-of-place pancakes.

        <h3>Hip Exoskeleton Suit</h3>
        Built a 3D CAD model and a MATLAB GUI program to interact with the CAD model. Fed GUI in- formation to SolidWorks 
        to resize suit proportionally to a person. Used Simulink to analyze model behaviour to different hip kinematics and 
        dynamics and make it fail-safe.
